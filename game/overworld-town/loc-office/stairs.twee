:: Office Stairwell
<<location "office_building">><<effects>><<exposure>>
You are in the stairwell on <<checkfloor>>. Besides the sound of the AC fan blowing, the stairwell is bereft of sound.
<br><br>

As the stairwell doors lock from the inside, the only exit is in the lobby, <<number $officeFloor>> floors below.

:: Office Stairwell Descend
<<effects>>
<<if $stairSpeed is 20>>
	You begin descending the gruelling stairwell. You keep a fast pace, but after a while your legs and feet start to burn with fatigue, so you decide to stop.
	<br><br>
<<elseif $stairSpeed is 10>>
	You make your way down the stairs. You keep a steady pace but soon begin to feel aches in your legs. You decide to stop.
<<else>>
	You head down the stairs. You keep a steady pace but stop before your legs get too tired.

:: Office Stairwell Rest
<<effects>>
You decide to rest before going further down the stairs.
<br>
<<if $rng gte 90 - $officeFloor>>
	While resting, you hear someone approaching the stairwell door.
	<br>
	"Yeah, the boss said that some streaker is on the steps, I'm going to check it out now," you hear a security guard say to someone on their radio.
	<br><br>
	If the guard sees you, you're going to get into trouble!

:: Office Stairwell Run Up
<<effects>>
You think it would be safer to run upstairs, so you gather your legs and start climbing.
<br>
"I'm going to check upstairs," the guard says, heading up the stairs.
<br><br>
<<set _ascendCount to random(1,3)>>
You stay ahead and out of sight of the guard, and they finally give up after <span class="blue">_ascendCount</span> floors.
<br>
"Heading back in, no one is here," the guard says before using their pass to exit the stairwell on the floor below you.
<<set $officeFloor += _ascendCount>>

:: Office Stairwell Run Down
<<effects>>
You think it would be safer to run downstairs, so you quickly start descending.
<br>
"Hey you, stop right there!" You hear the guard shout from above.
<br><br>

:: Office Stairwell Escape
<<effects>>
You ignore the guard and keep running, but fear this may come back to burn you later. <<ggsecurity>><<set $officecomplaints += 2>>

:: Office Stairwell Hide
<<effects>>
You decide to hide behind the door. The door swings outwards and the guard enters the stairwell. The guard begins ascending the stairs, unaware of your presence.
<br><br>
You wait a few moments to make sure you're safe and step away from the door.
