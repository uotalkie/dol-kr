Inspiration strikes you, and you decide to make the nest raised from the ground. You cross large pieces of wood as a foundation, leaving space for the nest itself to hang.
You also add in some random shiny junk. It won't improve the structure, but it's inexplicably pleasing to look at.
Your spouse works on the nest itself, and the two of you lift the base of it onto the frame you've made.

While <<bhe>> finishes meticulously placing each stick and log, you begin to sew fabric and lurker leather into small sacks. You fill them with leaves and feathers. It's the closest thing you'll get to a pillow out here.

You fill the nest with leaves, and throw two sewn sheets of fabric over the top. They're large enough to hang over the edges. Finally, you throw in your makeshift pillows. All that's left is to test it out.
